        <h2>Skills Display Projects:</h2>
        <p>
        These projects are mainly meant for displaying my skills with certain aspects of software development. I use these projects to prove I can perform similar tasks to what my employers will be assigning me.

            Bug-Tracker Project:  
            </h3>
            <p>
            The function of this project is to provide tools to software developers to document problems in the code so that they can be fixed. This is something that is universal for most software developers, and most software developers are familiar with what it is and how it works. Because of this, they know how it should be, and are able to compare this project with things they are familiar with. This helps them gauge how good of a software developer you are.

            Nutrition Project:
            </h3>
            <p>
            This passion project is one that I used to integrate my deep interest in nutrition with my interest and passion of computer science. It helps the user develop a personalized nutrition plan that they can customize based on what foods they like and what foods they dislike. This helps people who would otherwise be considered picky eaters still get all the nutrients they need in a day.
