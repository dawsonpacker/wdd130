        <h2>Class: Programming with Classes:</h2>
        <p>
        This was a more advanced computer science class that was done in the language of python, which had a focus on learning about how to use Classes in Code. We learned how to plan out a coding project, plan out the Classes we would use, plan which attributes each class would have, and plan which actions each class would perform. Then we coded it all out.

            Project: Hang Man Game: 
            </h3>
            <p>
            This project involved making a version of Hangman. It was the first time I applied classes to a program that I made and it served as an introduction to the concept of classes in general. In this project, you will be able to observe my understanding of the fundamental concepts of how classes work in python.
