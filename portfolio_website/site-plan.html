        [Dawson Packer’s Portfolio Website:  

        Welcome to my Portfolio Website. This website will give you both descriptions of and links to several distinct projects I have created over the years. From these projects and their descriptions, you will be able to deduce my software Development skills and see the kinds of value I am able to bring to you and your company. This value will come both from tangible skills, like my coding abilities, as well as less tangible traits, like my passion for computer science, and my curiosity and drive.  
        
         
        
        This website has both my school projects, and my personal projects. From my school projects, you will be able to see the lessons I’ve learned from school relate to what I will be doing in your company. From my personal projects, you will be able to see both my personal passion for computer science and what can be achieved with it, as well as my proactive drive for putting in the work of learning additional skills outside of school in order to be even better suited for the job.

      <h3>[School Projects]</h3>
      <p>
        [School Projects:  

        These are projects that I was required to do as part of my school curriculum. Some are from my more beginner classes while others are from my very advanced classes. Listed below are the different computer science classes I’ve taken that are most relevant, and the key Projects I did from each class.  
        
        Class: Programming with Classes:  
        
        This was a more advanced computer science class that was done in the language of python, which had a focus on learning about how to use Classes in Code. We learned how to plan out a coding project, plan out the Classes we would use, plan which attributes each class would have, and plan which actions each class would perform. Then we coded it all out.  
        
        Project: Hang Man Game:  
        
        This project involved making a version of Hangman. It was the first time I applied classes to a program that I made and it served as an introduction to the concept of classes in general. In this project, you will be able to observe my understanding of the fundamental concepts of how classes work in python.  </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Personal Projects]</h3>
      <p>
        [Personal Projects:  

        These are Projects that I did on my own time outside of class assignments. They are grouped into Skills Display Projects and Passion Projects. 
        
         
        
        Skills Display Projects:  
        These projects are mainly meant for displaying my skills with certain aspects of software development. I use these projects to prove to my employers that I can perform tasks they will be having me complete in the workforce.
        
        Bug-Tracker Project:  
        
        The function of this skills display project is to provide tools to software developers to document problems in the code so that they can be fixed. This is something that is universal for most software developers, and most software developers are familiar with what it is and how it works. Because of this, they know how it should be, and are able to compare your project with things they are familiar with. This helps them gauge how good of a software developer you are. 
        
         
        
        Passion Projects: 
        These are projects projects that I make for my own personal use and enjoyment, and show my interest and passion for software development. 
        
        Nutrition Project:  
        
        This passion project is one that I used to integrate my deep interest in nutrition with my interest and passion of computer science. It helps the user develop a personalized nutrition plan that they can customize based on what foods they like and what foods they dislike. This helps people who would otherwise be considered picky eaters still get all the nutrients they need in a day.
